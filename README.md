# Mysql_assignment10_Triggers
This assignment focuses on understanding and implementing SQL triggers . The primary objective is to create a Teachertableand using triggers to manage teacher data in the database efficiently. The first step in the assignment involves creating a teachers table, which holds crucial information about each teacher, such as their ID, name, subject, experience, and salary. Once the table is set up, the next step is to implement a Before Insert Trigger, which ensures that no negative salary values are inserted into the table by raising an error if such a value is detected. After that, an After Insert Trigger is created to log each insertion into a teacher_log table, capturing details such as the teacher's ID, the action performed (INSERT), and the timestamp of the insertion. The third part of the assignment involves creating a Before Delete Trigger, which prevents the deletion of teachers with more than 10 years of experience by raising an error if such a deletion is attempted. Finally, an After Delete Trigger is implemented to log any deletion actions, recording the teacher's details and the timestamp of the deletion into the teacher_log table. Through these steps, the assignment demonstrates how SQL triggers can be used to enforce data integrity, automate logging, and manage business rules effectively within a relational database system.
